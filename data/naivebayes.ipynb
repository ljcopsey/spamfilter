We represent a message using a **binary** [bag-of-words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model) model. Specifically, a message is represented as a set of $k$ keywords, that is, $message = (w_1, ..., w_k)$, where $w_i = 1$ if the  keyword $w_i$ appears in the message and $w_i = 0$ otherwise.\n",

Don't let the name scare you, this model simply assigns probabilities to different counts of events with multiple outcomes. So for example: \"I roll a biased six-sided die six times, what is the probability that I get each side occurring exactly once\" is a question that can be answered with a multinomial distribution. You don't need to understand all of the equations on the Wikipedia page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, the multinomial distribution assumes that the words of a message were \"drawn\" independently from a bag of $k$ different words. Depending on the class membership $c$, each keyword $w$ has a probability $\\theta_{c, w}$ of being drawn. For example,\n",

    "One way to do this is to follow the rough structure of the class that already exists in that notebook. You can use the `train` method to pass in the data and perform all of the steps before the prediction. You should store data in instance variables, e.g. `self.log_class_priors` and `self.log_class_conditional_likelihoods`. This means that then you can set up the `predict` method to match the one above without needing to pass in the additional variables. **Important:** the predict method must only take a single variable as a parameter (the one called `new_data`) in the skeleton code above."
